## Quinn.so 

Quinn.so is a SaaS platform for freelance music teachers. It helps them manage their business, and integrates AI to help them organize their students, files, schedule, and billing.

## About 

I'm Sam Morgan, a product developer for Bubble. By day, I use no-code to build user-onboarding flows and ecosystem features for @bubble. Quinn.so is my side project, and I've decided to make the repository public because I'm still learning to code and use github, and I'm not opposed to open sourcing things and collaborating. 

## Getting started

Quinn.so is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
